Elara pushed open the creaking wooden door of the old cabin. 
Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight piercing the gloom.
A faint smell of mildew and damp earth hung in the air, a testament to years of disuse. 
She stepped inside, her boots scuffing softly on the rough-hewn floorboards.
The silence was profound, broken only by the distant drip of water somewhere deeper within the structure.

She moved towards the small, boarded-up window. 
With a grunt, she pried away one of the rotting planks.
A sudden gust of wind whistled through the newly opened gap, carrying with it the scent of pine and wet leaves.
Outside, the forest was a dark, brooding presence, its ancient trees swaying gently in the breeze.

A low scratching sound came from behind the fireplace. 
Elara froze, her hand instinctively reaching for the small knife she carried.
The scratching continued, faint but persistent, like tiny claws on stone. Her breath hitched in her throat.

Slowly, she crept towards the sound. 
The scratching stopped abruptly.
A high-pitched squeak echoed from the shadows, followed by the scuttling of something small and fast.
Relief washed over her; just a mouse. She let out a shaky breath, the tension easing from her shoulders.

As twilight deepened, the cabin grew colder.
The wind outside began to howl, a mournful lament through the trees.
Elara lit a small, flickering candle, its feeble light casting dancing shadows on the walls.
She knew this place held secrets, and the night was just beginning.
