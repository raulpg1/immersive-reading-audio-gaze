Elara pushed open the creaking wooden door of the old cabin. 
Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight piercing the gloom.
A faint smell of mildew and damp earth hung in the air, a testament to years of disuse. 
She stepped inside, her boots scuffing softly on the rough-hewn floorboards.
The silence was profound, broken only by the distant drip of water somewhere deeper within the structure.

She moved towards the small, boarded-up window. 
With a grunt, she pried away one of the rotting planks.
A sudden gust of wind whistled through the newly opened gap, carrying with it the scent of pine and wet leaves.
Outside, the forest was a dark, brooding presence, its ancient trees swaying gently in the breeze.
