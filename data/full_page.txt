Caelan walked onto the old path, feeling the uneven stones move under his boots as he looked at the overgrown clearing around him.
A gentle breeze blew, bringing the smell of wet pine and faraway rain clouds, and it moved the tall grass at the edge of the path.
Somewhere ahead, a soft creak sounded, like old wood bending in the wind, and he stopped, listening to every quiet noise.
His breath stayed calm but careful as night came on and shadows grew longer.

He reached an old gate, its hinges rusty but still working, and it swung a little each time the wind blew.
The air felt heavy, as if the place was waiting for him to move on.
A crow called from far off, its cry echoing in the stillness.
He went forward, following a faint light past the gate.

Inside the small yard, broken pots lay scattered among twisted vines, and he smelled old incense hanging in the air.
He saw a boarded-up window with a cracked corner, letting a thin beam of moonlight fall on the dusty floor inside.
A soft buzz came from deeper in the building, like quiet gears turning.
He paused with his hand on the doorframe, listening for more.

He entered the dim room and heard a hidden clock ticking in a quiet way, and somewhere a teacup sat too close to the edge and gave a soft clink, as if reminding him someone had been here.
A faint tune drifted in, barely heard over the silence, mixing feelings of past and present.
He sensed movement behind a curtain, a slight rustle that could mean friend or enemy, and he braced himself.
Then a sudden crash of glass broke the uneasy calm, and he stepped back as his heart raced.
